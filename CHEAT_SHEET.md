## Flutter
See also the Coc section
Custom commands at config/mappings.vim
```
See config/mappings.vim to see my custom mappings for Flutter COC commands

:ter flutter pub global run devtools
:CocCommand flutter.dev.openDevLog - opens nicely colored log
:CocCommand flutter.dev.openDevToolsProfiler - opens Flutter dev tools with debugger
```

## GIT

```
See config/mappings.vim to see my custom mappings for git

:GitFiles -> search in git files
:Gdiffsplit -> two splits with diff
:GBrowse -> go to file on GitHub (browser)
:GV -> git commit browser
:GV! -> only commits affecting current file
  - o - to open a commit
  - l - to open a file in a commit
```

## Test

```
:TestNearest - In a test file runs the test nearest to the cursor, otherwise runs the last nearest test. In test frameworks that don't support line numbers it will polyfill this functionality with regexes.
:TestFile - In a test file runs all tests in the current file, otherwise runs the last file tests.
:TestSuite - Runs the whole test suite (if the current file is a test file, runs that framework's test suite, otherwise determines the test framework from the last run test).
:TestLast - Runs the last test.
:TestVisit - Visits the test file from which you last run your tests (useful when you're trying to make a test pass, and you dive deep into application code and close your test buffer to make more space, and once you've made it pass you want to go back to the test file to write more tests).
:TtestFile --no-sound-null-safety - and other options can be added
```

## Multicursor

```
<C-n> - select a selection, add next occurance of the selection with next cursor <C-n>
      - then use normal stuff <d><i><c> to work with the multi-selection 
<C-x> - skip current instance

To work with single chars like , in [a,b,c] - go to visual mode and then <C-n>

Commenting multiple lines:
<C-v> - open visual mode, select lines, <I>,<jj>
```

## Surround

```
cs"' - will replace a pair of "" with ''
cs'<q> - will replace a par of '' with <q></q>
```

## Common issues

`brew install ripgrep` - otherwise :Rg will not work

## Plugins

### Flutter/Dart
https://github.com/natebosch/vim-lsc
https://github.com/natebosch/vim-lsc-dart
https://github.com/dart-lang/dart-vim-plugin 
https://github.com/iamcco/coc-flutter 
https://github.com/theniceboy/coc-flutter-tools
https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim 
https://github.com/thosakwe/vim-flutter
https://github.com/akinsho/flutter-tools.nvim 

### Other to consider
https://github.com/folke/todo-comments.nvim - TODO management, could not make it work
https://github.com/tpope/vim-unimpaired - some mappings to consider
https://github.com/mfussenegger/nvim-dap - apparently there is a way with flutter-tools.nvim and this to debug directly in VIM instead of dev tools

## What I am missing

* highlighting dart HEX colors 
* icon previews 
* autosave + autoformat in dart conflicting
* IDE like search and replace in all files
* proper debugging in nvim
* moving files with impmorts updated properly
